College of Education was founded in June 1926 during the rectorate of Very Rev. Fr. Manuel Arellano, O.P. Classes at the college commenced in Intramuros, Manila. It offered the four-year Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.) degree.\nIn 1940, the normal school was established and offered a two-year course leading to Elementary Teachers Certificate (E.T.C.). In 1941, the Elementary Training Department was opened as a laboratory school of the College of Education. In 1953, the degree Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (B.S.H.E.) was offered. In June 1954, the Elementary Teachers Certificate was changed into a four-year degree called Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. From 1955-1957, a new major in Food and Nutrition was added; and later transformed into Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition (B.S.F.N.).\nIn the school year 1970-71, the Institute of Nutrition was established as an independent body from the College of Education under the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs. Another significant event in 1971 was the merging of the Normal School with the College of Education due to the decreasing enrollment rate of the former. In July 1971, a Special Assistant to the Dean was created to take charge of the Normal elementary School since the Directress and the Secretary of the School positions were abolished.\nFrom 1974-1976, the College offered new major studies in Chemistry and in School Guidance & Character Education. The latter major replaced the co-major in Theology. The College introduced the following terminal courses to meet the demands for manpower: Certificate in Practical Arts (2 years),Certificate in Practical Dietetics (2 years) and Tourist Guide Certificate (1 year). The two former courses/programs were later on phased out while the Tourist Guide Certificate was changed into Associate in Tourism (2 years).\nIn the 1980s, the College of Education phased out all vocational courses/programs and the Institute of Nutrition was abolished. Later on, the College offered the following four-year degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Bachelor of Science in Hotel & Restaurant Management.\nFrom 1990-1992, new majors for the Bachelor of Secondary Education program were offered: Computer Technology Education; Home Management and Vocational Technology (which replaced Home Economics); and Values Education (which replaced the Guidance and Character Education). The Early Childhood Education was also introduced as a new major for the Bachelor of Elementary Education program.\nIn the School Year 2006-07, the B.S. Tourism and B.S. Hotel and Restaurant Management programs were transferred into a newly established body of the University - the Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management (I.T.H.M.). The I.T.H.M. was later renamed as College of Tourism and Hospitality Management.\nIn 2004, the College collaborated with Hanyang University (South Korea) for a student-exchange program.\nIn 2007, the College was the second top performing school in the nutrition-dietetics board exam with a passing rate of 80%, higher than the national passing rate of 56.40%. Four Thomasians entered the Top Ten Examinees of the said P.R.C. examination.\nIn the April 2008 Licensure Examination for Teachers (Secondary Level), the College was the second top performing school with a high 95% passing rate. Two Thomasian BSEd alumni entered the Top Ten Examinees' list.\nIn the school year 2008-09, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs have been granted the Center of Excellence (COE) status after undergoing the stringent evaluation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd). The COE status lasted from June 2, 2008 until June 2, 2011.\nIn 2008, the Department of Education (DepEd) designated the College as a Center of Training (COT) in MAPEH. Since then, DepEd and U.S.T. College of Education have been collaborating for the annual Teacher Induction Program (T.I.P.) for the public school teachers.\nIn April 2009, Asst. Prof. Leonila Wilhelmina N.
