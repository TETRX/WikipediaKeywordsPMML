He emigrated from his communist motherland in the early 1968s. Before that, he studied at Wroclaw Polytechnic in Wroclaw, Poland, where he obtained his master's degree in Electronic Instrumentation. During 1960-1968, he worked in Institute of Physics at Uppsala University in Sweden, where he got his Ph.D. title. On March 3, 1968 he emigrated to the United States where he started his own company, Columbus Instruments, producing bio-medical and ecological equipment based on his own inventions. Columbus Instruments sells research equipment to 50 countries, including Poland.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHe received an M.S. in electrical engineering from Wroclaw Technical University in Poland and a Ph.D. from Uppsala University in Sweden. In 1968 he emigrated to the United States, and in 1970 founded Columbus Instruments, a manufacturer and exporter of medical research equipment, of which he is owner and president. The company employs nearly fifty people and exports to over fifty countries worldwide.\n\n\n== Professional and Cultural Associations ==\nJan Czekajewski also publishes articles on social and political issues. He participates in social events organized by Polish-American community. On December 17, 2010, he participated in Miedzyorganizacyjny Oplatek Swiateczny in Consulate General of Poland in New York City, where he discussed issues related to his work with engineers from Association of Polish-American Engineers, Polonia Technica, Inc.. He also showcased his book, which was released in June 2010.\n\nPolish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA) in New York City\nPolonia Technica, Association of Polish-American Engineers\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn 1998, Jan Czekajewski was recognized by Senate and Congress of Ohio State as the best hi-tech businessman.\n\n\n== Patents ==\nU.S. Patent 4,337,726.
