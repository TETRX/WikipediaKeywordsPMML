    "text": "A temperature\u2013entropy diagram, or T\u2013s diagram, is a thermodynamic diagram used in thermodynamics to visualize changes to temperature and specific entropy during a thermodynamic process or cycle as the graph of a curve. It is a useful and common tool, particularly because it helps to visualize the heat transfer during a process. For reversible (ideal) processes, the area under the T\u2013s curve of a process is the heat transferred to the system during that process.Working fluids are often categorized on the basis of the shape of their T\u2013s diagram.\nAn isentropic process is depicted as a vertical line on a T\u2013s diagram, whereas an isothermal process is a horizontal line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarnot cycle\nPressure\u2013volume diagram\nRankine cycle\nSaturation vapor curve\nWorking fluid\nWorking fluid selection\n\n\n== References ==",
