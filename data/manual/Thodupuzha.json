    "text": "Thodupuzha (\u0d24\u0d4a\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d34) is a municipality in Idukki district in the Kerala state of India, spread over an area of 35.43 km2. Thodupuzha is 57 km (35 mi) from Kottayam and 60 km (37 mi) south east of Kochi. Thodupuzha is 200 km from the state capital, Trivandrum. Geographical classification of Thodupuzha Region is Malanad or Idanad.\nThodupuzha is also the name of the river that flows through the town. It is one of the largest towns in the district and is a main commercial center. The town is being modernized with the help of a program sponsored by the World Bank, financing through the Government of Kerala. It was once part of the territory of the princely state, Travancore.  It lies in central Kerala, southeast of Muvattupuzha. The Thodupuzha municipality area is characterized by abundant vegetation.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe place named 'Thodupuzha' by Elasamprathi Narayana Varma from two words, 'thodu' (which means a rivulet) and 'puzha' (which means a river). It is believed that the stream developed into a river, and the town on the banks of the river came to be known as Thodupuzha.     \nThere is another version which defines the word \u2018thodu\u2019 (old Malayalam word) as \u2018touch\u2019 and \u2018puzha\u2019 as \u2018river\u2019. Thus the town touching the river became Thodupuzha.\nMattathil Kovilakam was the protectors and rulers of the Desham (region) Thodupuzha that they were in and a reported relationship emerged to a \"Naadu Vaazhi\" (Ruler of the land)of Keezhmalainadu. Naadu, which is a group of Deshams, came to known as Thodupuzha. The last ruler of the desam was Elasamprathi(Ruler of a region appointed by His Highness Marthanda Varma Maharaja of Travancore) Elasmprathi Narayana Varma originally from Trivandrum and he was the representative of Maharaja Raja. His official residence was Mattathil Kovilakam located in Chalamkode Village. Official Headquarters of Keezhmalainadu were Karikodu.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Kings of Vadakkumkoor used to live at Karikode for several years. Vadakkumkur was a late medieval/early modern feudal principality located in the Indian state of Kerala.Headquarters of the Kingdom of Vadakkumkur was at Karikkode in Thodupuzha.   Thekkumkur, it succeeded from the early medieval political region of Vempolinad by around 1200 AD. After their separation, Thekkumkur became an independent kingdom, while Vadakkumkur became a vassal of Cochin. During the time of Portuguese dominance in Cochin, disputes arose between the Vadakkumkur chieftain and the Kingdom of Cochin over the pepper trade and the Vadakkumkur Rajah was killed in battle with Cochin and their Portuguese allies.After the attack Vadakkumkur palace shifted in to two branches and one known as Mattathil Palace remains at Thondikkuzha(Chalamkode) and the other one is at Kadanadu Pala Vadakkumkur and Thekkumkur were later annexed by Marthanda Varma and incorporated into the Kingdom of Travancore.Maharaja appointed his representative known as Sarvadhikari Elasamprathi Narayana Varam to develop the region called Keezhmalainadu. Narayana Varma known as the father of Keezhmalainadu and modern Thodupuzha. The period of his reign was the golden age of Keezhmalainadu. He erected many monuments, including the government offices, Pandika Shala and Temples. The Karikode Mosque and other buildings in Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha also date from his reign. He was also the founder of the new style of tax collection in this region. He traveled every day from Chalamkode to Karikkodu in a Pallakku (palanquin). The relics of the fort is still there at Karikode. The Annamalai Temple, which carries the traits of Tamil Architecture is at Karikode. At this temple are statues and lamps made out of stone and metal, believed to have been made in the 14th century. Thodupuzha is an ancient town with a history dating back to many centuries. The Buddhist and Jain religions which made their first inroads into Kerala in 300 BC have left their impact at Thodupuzha and neighboring areas. The Buddhist religious relics found at Karikode near Thodupuzha is proof of this. In the 14th century AD, Kerala was divided for administrative reasons into several provinces such as Venadu, Otanadu, Navishainadu, Munjunadu, Vempolinadu, and Keezhmalainadu. Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha were in Keezhmalainadu which had its headquarters at Karikode. Keezhmalainadu was in existence until AD 1600. In that year it lost a battle with Vadakkumkoor and became a part of it. The church at Muthalakodam, a small town, 4 kilometers from Thodupuzha, is believed to have been constructed before the 13th century. The Ninnar Mosque near Karikode is said to have been constructed by Sarvadikari Elasmprathi Narayana Varma for his Muslim soldiers.. No one in Thodupuzha knows this Elsambrathi Narayana Varma. The area which is talking about is only a village near Thodupuzha (a ruined village). It has no way connected to Thodupuzha modern township. Wikipedia just not moke facts. \nAt the formation of Kerala state in 1956, Thodupuzha was part of the Ernakulam district. In 1972, Idukki district was formed by merging Thodupuzha taluk along with Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peermade taluks, which were part of the erstwhile Kottayam district.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2001 India census, the total population of 46,226. Males constitute 49%of the population and females 51%.  Thodupuzha has an average literacy rate of 82%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 84%, and female literacy is 81%. In Thodupuzha, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nThodupuzha has an excellent network of highways and roads that connects it to the nearby towns and cities. The Main Eastern Highway (Muvattupuzha - Punalur / SH-08 / 154 km) passes through Thodupuzha and connects it to two of its neighboring towns, Muvattupuzha and Pala. Thodupuzha-Puliyanmala road (SH-33) connects Thodupuzha to Idukki District centre at Painavu as well as tourist destinations like Idukki Dam and Thekkadi. Alappuzha-Madurai road (SH-40) also passes through Thodupuzha town. SH-43 which connects Muvattupuzha with Theni passes through some parts of the Thodupuzha Taluk but doesn't pass through Thodupuzha town. Other state highways, Thekkady - Ernakulam, and Sabarimala - Neryamangalam also passes through Thodupuzha town. New 4 Lane Highway Proposed from Muvattupuzha to Kakkanad if materializes will connect Thodupuzha to Kochi in Less than 45 minutes to reach reducing the distance to 50 kilometers.\nThodupuzha - Pala, Thodupuzha - Muvattupuzha highways are one of the best roads in Kerala which were recently upgraded by KSTP.\nThe newly constructing KSRTC bus station (construction begins from 2013 till now not opened for public . The Thodupuzha MLA PJ Joseph do not have much interest in this now. If we contacted him also there is no positive response from him. Many distant passenger's are facing problem due to this)will give depot status (now a Sub depot) to Thodupuzha KSRTC station. Many new interstate services expected to start from Thodupuzha after the commissioning of the new KSRTC bus station. Bus services at frequent intervals are there to nearby places like Kottayam, Ernakulam, Vaikom, Kattappana, Thrissur, and Trivandrum from Thodupuzha. Recently this depot has added several high-tech low-floor buses, which provide luxury transportation facilities to their fleet.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nAt present Thodupuzha has no railway connectivity. The nearest major Railway Stations are Aluva railway station which is 55 kilometres away from Thodupuzha, Kottayam railway station is at 54 kilometres away from Thodupuzha. The proposed Angamaly-Erumely Sabari Railway to Sabarimala passes through Thodupuzha, and Thodupuzha railway station is planned to be constructed near Thodupuzha Co-operative hospital. Construction of Sabari Railway is completed up to Kalady railway station and Periyar bridge. The railway link will probably complete till Muvattupuzha and maybe, up to Thodupuzha. Railways see the terrain as difficult due to hills and loose soil in the Meenachil taluk and beyond. Also, the population density is lower in Thodupuzha, Pala, and southwards, known as low ranges, in the foothills of Western ghats. There is also opposition from locals in the eastern part of Kottayam district through which the proposed railway alignment is.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nThodupuzha's economy is driven by agriculture, business, and small industries. Farmers in Thodupuzha raise a number of crops, mostly rubber. Other crops such as pineapple, coconut, rice, pepper, cocoa, tapioca, banana, ginger, turmeric etc. are also being cultivated in plenty. In recent years Thodupuzha has shown more interest in promoting tourism. The face of Thodupuzha changed a lot in the last decade owing to developments since the changeover of the status from Taluk to Municipality. The new private bus stand, Temple Bypass road, Kanjiramattom Bypass road, Kothayikkunnu Bypass, Vengaloor Bypass, Mangattu Kavala four-lane road, Mini Civil Station, New Bridge, Municipal Park, Shopping complex at bus stand, New Townhall complex, etc. are noted landmarks which changed the look of Thodupuzha to a planned city. The first manufacturing industry in the District, Dhanwanthari Vaidyasala has its headquarters in Thodupuzha. The footwear brand Lunar's has its operations base at Thodupuzha. Thodupzha is strategically located in the route of Highranges to other Central Kerala towns like Ernakulam and Kottayam. However the lack of well-developed roads from Highranges to reach Thodupuzha has led to the usage of Aluva - Munnar road and Kottayam - Kumaly road as the main transport route by the people of the uplands. They are new proposed state highways: Thekkady - Ernakulam, and Muvattupuzha - Theni.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThodupuzha was administered by a village panchayat and village union for several years, but on 1 September 1978, Thodupuzha was upgraded into a municipality. The Thodupuzha Municipality was formed by merging the Thodupuzha Panchayat and the neighboring Panchayats of Kumaramangalam, Karicodu, and Manacaud.

Chandran as the Chairman. Today the Municipality has 35 wards. There is a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, and various Standing Committees to carry out the civic administration.
