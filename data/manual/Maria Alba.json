Her most notable appearances (as Maria Alba) were probably as \"Saturday\" in the 1932 Douglas Fairbanks film Mr. Robinson Crusoe, and as the exotic \"Princess Nadji\" in the Bela Lugosi serial The Return of Chandu. Other Latin actresses working in films, like Lupe V\u00e9lez or Dolores del R\u00edo, became fluent in English, but Maria Alba spoke English with a thick accent, which limited her casting opportunities.\nPublicity materials for The Return of Chandu, published in 1934, disclosed that Maria Alba's married name was Mrs. David Todd. On July 9, 1950, she married Richard J. Burk; the couple had three children.\n\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaria Alba on IMDb\nMaria Alba at Virtual History",
