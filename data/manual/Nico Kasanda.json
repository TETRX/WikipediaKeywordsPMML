He graduated in 1957 as a technical teacher, but inspired by his musical family, he took up the guitar and in time became a virtuoso soloist.At the age of 14, Kasanda started playing with the seminal group Grand Kalle et l'African Jazz, led by Joseph \"Grand Kalle\" Kabaselle. He became an influential guitarist (Jimi Hendrix  visited him while on tour in Paris), and the originator of the ubiquitous Congolese finger-picked guitar style, acquiring the nickname \"Dr. Nico\".
