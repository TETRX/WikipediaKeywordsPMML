    "text": "Pain de mie is a white, or brown,  bread, with a thin soft crust. It is mostly sold sliced and packaged. \"Pain\" in French means \"bread\", and \"la mie\" refers to the soft part of bread, called the crumb. In English, pain de mie is most similar to a pullman loaf, or to regular sandwich bread. Pain de mie usually has sugar in it, which makes it sweeter than most French breads. This bread is usually used for making sandwiches, or for toasting. It can be baked in a sealed pan, which prevents crust from forming. If not baked in a sealed pan, the crust can be cut off (as done in factories before packaging). Pain de mie is sold in rounded or rectangular shapes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nM.
