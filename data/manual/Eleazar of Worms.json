Through his father Judah ben Kalonymus, he was a descendant of the great Kalonymus family of Mainz. Eleazar was also a disciple of Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg (Judah he-Hasid), who initiated him into the study of the Kabbalah, at that time little known in Germany. According to Zunz, Eleazar was hazzan at Erfurt before he became rabbi at Worms. In 1233 he took part in the Synod of Mainz which enacted the body of regulations known as \"Takkanot Shum\" (ShUM = \"Speyer, Worms, Mainz\"), of which he was a signatory.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Encyclopedia, Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the Crusades. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that on the night of 22 Kislev, 1196, he was engaged in his commentary on Genesis (Eleazar relates that he had reached the parashah Vayeshev), when two Crusaders entered his house and killed his wife  Dulca (Dolce), his two daughters Belet (Belette) and Hannah, and wounded him and his son Jacob who did not escape. His wife had conducted a business in parchment scrolls in order to support the family and enable him to devote all his time to study.  Many of the piyyutim he authored protest at Israel's suffering and hope for redemption and revenge against her tormentors. He also recorded the deaths of his family in a moving and poetic eulogy.\nEleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a liturgist gifted with a clear and easy style, and an astronomer, and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous mystic who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread mystical systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of Jewish esoterica. In his mystical works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet.  By the gematria and notarikon systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The haggadic anthropomorphism which he had combated in his earlier works (Ha-Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25, Sha'are ha-Sod weha-Yi\u1e25ud) occupied later the foremost place in his mystical writings.\nEleazar's great merit therefore lies not only in his new mystical system, but also in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon asceticism. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.\n\n\n== Ethical works ==\nHa-Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25, (\"The Perfumer\"), a halachic guide to ethics and Jewish Law for the common reader.  The title derives from the numerical value of the word \u05e8\u05e7\u05d7, which corresponds to that of \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8. The book is divided into 497 paragraphs containing halachot and ethics; first published at Fano, 1505.\nAdderet ha-Shem, still extant in manuscript in the Vatican Library.\nMoreh \u1e24a\u1e6d\u1e6da'im, or Seder ha-Kapparot, on penitence and confession of sin, first published at Venice, 1543.
