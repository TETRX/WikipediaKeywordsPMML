So, the Fortress would come to guarantee the safety of European occupation, giving resistance to the network of the traffic of the slaves, who were sent to America, from the harbour of Luanda.\nThe Fortress of Penedo was, since its first building, one of the keys of the Luanda harbour protection. And secretly it cantoned the slaves and assured their sending to the lands of \"New World\" (America).\nThe new fortress was built between 1765 and 1766, and was also used as a prison of the Portuguese Political Police.\nThis Fortress is badly preserved due to its age and its activity as a Prison.\n\n\n== World Heritage Status ==\nThis site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on November 22, 1996 in the Cultural category.\n\n\n== References ==",
