    "text": "Athiyam\u0101n Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ji was one of the most powerful Velir kings of the Sangam era who ruled the region called Mazhanadu, a part of ancient Kongu Nadu and the great dynasty called Chera Dynasty. A famous royal Athiyam\u0101n family dynasty was the contemporary and the patron of poet Avvaiyar of the Sangam period. Athiyam\u0101n who ruled over the Dharmapuri, Salem and surrounding areas with their capital at Tagadur (now known as Dharmapuri). The most famous of their line were the father-son duo: Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ci and Elini (the son). They were one of the Kadai ezhu vallal (7 great patrons) of arts and literature in ancient Tamilakam.\n\n\n== Patron of Avvaiyar ==\nWhen poet Avvaiyar visited the court of Athiyam\u0101n Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ci, he liked her so much that he deliberately delayed in giving her gifts to prolong her stay. The poet at first not realizing the game, got angry and condemned him and then later when she realized the true motive, became so fond him that she decided to stay and became his close friend. On another occasion, he gave her the gooseberry (nelli) fruit to the poet with the hope of improving her life expectancy.\n\n\n== A warrior ==\nAvvaiyar described her patron as a hardened warrior, Purananuru, song 87:\n\nEnemies! take care,when you enter the field of battle,Among us is a warrior, who is like a chariot wheel,made painstakingly by a carpenter,who tosses off eight chariots in a day!\nIn 118 CE, another king Malaiyam\u0101n Thirumudi K\u0101ri of the Kadai ezhu vallal waged war on Thagadoor against Athiyam\u0101n Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ci. It was an attempt fuelled by his longtime desire to become an emperor equivalent in power to the Cholas. After a fierce battle, K\u0101ri lost Kovalur to Athiyam\u0101n and  only regained it much later after Peruncheral Irumporai sacked Tagadur.\n\n\n== Friendship with the Cholas ==\nAthiyam\u0101n Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ci lived in one of the most turbulent periods and was looking at an imminent invasion by the Cheras and the Cholas. He  sent Avvaiyar as an envoy to the court of Ilantiraiyan of Kanchi who was a viceroy of the Chola sovereign and later allied himself with the latter to deter the Chera king. Avvaiyar was given a grand welcome by Tondaim\u0101n who then went on to proudly show her his archery. Though impressed, Avvaiyar refused to give up her patron by subtly hinting that the king's weapons sparkled as they were probably never used whereas the arsenal of her patron were all worn out as they had seen numerous wars.\n\n\n== Valiant opponent of Peru\u00f1c\u0113ral Irumporai ==\nBut this congregation of Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ci with the Chola and Pandya did not deter the Chera emperor, Peru\u00f1c\u0113ral Irumporai who finally arrived and sacked Tagadur. In spite of his small army, Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ci,led from the front and valiantly went down fighting in the battle field. AricilKil\u0101r, the war bard of Peru\u00f1c\u0113ral Irumporai, paid due homage to the opponent of his patron as he eulogised his king in Tagadur-Y\u0101ttarai.Upon his death, a distressed Avvaiyar  sang a number of elegies:\n\nan excerpt from Purananuru, song 235:If he had a little liquor, he would give it to usWhere is he now?..if he had even a little rice, he shared it in many platesWhere is he now?..He gave us all the flesh on the bonesWhere is he now?Wherever spear and arrows flew, he was thereWhere is he now?..father, mainstay, kingWhere is he now?.\nan excerpt from Purananuru, song 231:..The fame of our sun-like kinghis white umbrellascool as the moonwill not blackenwill not die!\n\n\n== Inscriptions ==\nA good number of inscriptions in Jambai in Tirukkoyilur taluk have been discovered which help us identify the Satyaputras of the Ashoka's edicts:\n\nSatyaput\u014d Athiyan Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ji itta Pali\nThe abode given by Athiyan Nedum\u0101n A\u00f1ji, the Satyaput\u014d\nThese put to rest any speculation regarding the identity of Satyaputras as being non-Tamil and goes on to show the greatness of this line as they are mentioned on par with the other three Tamil kingdoms.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\u015ar\u012b pu\u1e63p\u0101\u00f1jali: recent researches in prehistory, protohistory, art, architecture, numismatics, iconography, and epigraphy : Dr. C.R.
