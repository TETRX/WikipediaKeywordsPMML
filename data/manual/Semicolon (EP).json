It was released through Pledis Entertainment on October 19, 2020, four months after its predecessor, Heng:gar\u00e6 (2020).The album consists of six tracks, including the lead single \"Home;Run\", all of which have been co-written by the band members. Sporting a retro sound, Semicolon primarily incorporates dance-pop, funk, pop, acid jazz, and bossa nova, while also experimenting with hip hop, R&B, trap, and jazz elements. Recorded and released as a \"special album\", the record lyrically reaches out to the youth who are enduring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, offering comfort and encouragement. \nCommercially, the album reached number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and number two on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart. Seventeen promoted the album with televised live performances on several South Korean weekly music programs, including M! Countdown, Music Bank, and Inkigayo.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSeventeen's special EP was much anticipated after the band earned the moniker of \"million seller\" with their previous album Heng:gar\u00e6, released in June 2020, which became their first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. Pledis  Entertainment posted a 40-second trailer video on October 5, 2020, which revealed that Seventeen would be releasing a new EP Semicolon the same month. Recorded as a \"special album\", Semicolon speaks out to the young people who are enduring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Described by band member Mingyu as a \"youth diary\", Semicolon thematically follows its predecessor Heng:gar\u00e6, though the band began working on the album prior to the latter.\n; [Semicolon] is an album that spreads a message of support for youth who run endlessly. Like the very punctuation, ; [Semicolon] represents a brief pause and moment to take a breath, exchanging laughter with one another even amidst the hardships of the generation. We hope to give our peers living today warmth, comfort, and support.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n; [Semicolon] consists of six songs which urge the listeners to \"take some time off in their busy lives.\" The album touches upon themes of youth, encouragement, and comfort. The opening track, \"Home;Run\" is an uptempo '20s and '30s swing and dance-pop song, with a retro-indebted sound. The song incorporates strong brass sound, \"chipper\" finger-snaps, cheerful beats and jazz-inflected piano harmony in its production and Asian instruments in its bridge. The lyrics emphasize the passion of youth and deliver comfort to the listener through baseball metaphors. Elaborating on the sound and the lyrics, Woozi explained, \"We expressed the feeling of hitting a home run with a rhythmical and hard-hitting sound.\" The following track, \"Do Re Mi\" (Korean: \ub3c4\ub808\ubbf8) is an anthemic slow burn number featuring a trap bassline. \"Hey Buddy\" is a funk and pop song featuring '80s instrumentation and brass sound. The third track, \"Light A Flame\" (Korean: \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \ubd88\uc744 \uc9c0\ud3b4) incorporates Latin-inflected bossa nova jazzy rap with an orchestral pitch. \"Ah! Love\" is an acoustic synth number with jazz, hip hop and R&B influences. Performed by the vocal unit, the track is features vocal harmonies and guitar instrumentation. The album concludes with the midtempo mellow acid jazz and synth ballad, \"All My Love\" (Korean: \uaca8\uc6b0), featuring '90s nostalgic hooks.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe album's title and release date were announced on October 5.
