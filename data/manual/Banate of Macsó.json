It was retaken by Hungarians (c. 1200) and later administered as part of the feudal domain of duke John Angelos of Syrmia. During that time, the region of Ma\u010dva was also known as the Lower Syrmia (lat. Sirmia ulterior).Rostislav Mikhailovich was mentioned among the dignitaries of B\u00e9la IV as Ban of Slavonia in 1247, and from 1254 onward he was mentioned as the Duke of Macs\u00f3 (in Latin, dux de Macho). This was the first mention of the Banate of Macs\u00f3. The banate was named after a town called Macs\u00f3 (Ma\u010dva or Macho), but the location of this settlement has not been clearly established in modern times. It is suspected that the town existed a few kilometers down the river from modern \u0160abac.The Banate of Macs\u00f3 was ruled by several powerful bans. In the 13th century, B\u00e9la of Macs\u00f3 (grandson of Hungarian king B\u00e9la IV and son of Rostislav Mikhailovich) ruled the Banate of Macs\u00f3 as well as Usora and Soli (areas across Drina river in today's northeastern Bosnia).\nMacs\u00f3 soon become apple of discord between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbia. King Stephen Uro\u0161 I of Serbia tried to conquer it in 1268, but was defeated and captured by the Hungarians. In 1284, King Stephen Dragutin of Serbia, son of Uro\u0161 I, married Catherine of Hungary and received Macs\u00f3 from King Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Since the central power in the Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, Stephen Dragutin ruled an independent kingdom centered in Macs\u00f3, which also included regions of Usora and Soli in northern Bosnia, as well as Belgrade, Rudnik and Brani\u010devo. This kingdom was known as the Kingdom of Syrmia (Srem) and Stephen Dragutin ruled it as king until his death in 1316.Macs\u00f3 remained in the hands of Dragutin's son Stephen Vladislaus II until 1319. The northern part of the region along the river Sava was captured by King Charles I of Hungary while the southern part remained firmly under Serbian administration.In the 14th century, the bans of the Garai family (Paul I Garai, Nicholas I Garai and his son Nicholas II Garai) expanded their rule not only to Bosnia but also to Upper Syrmia and the last one also became the ban of Slavonia and Croatia, which were also parts of the Kingdom of Hungary at the time.\nIn the 1370s it was captured by Serbian Prince Lazar who in 1377\u20131378 donated several villages in Macs\u00f3 to his newly founded monastery of Ravanica. Lazars's son despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 was officially granted with possession of Macs\u00f3 by King Sigismund of Hungary in 1403 as a vassal of the Hungarian ruler. The territory got back to Hungary with Lazarevi\u0107's death (1427). The Hungarian bans of Macs\u00f3 existed during this period as well but only as titular holders and the title of ban was usually granted to the ispans (counts) of southern counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. \nThe territory was conquered by the Ottomans around 1459, after the fall of the Serbian Despotate. The region was regained for the Kingdom of Hungary in 1476, when the fortress of Zaslon (modern \u0160abac) was taken. By the end of the 15th century, title of ban was transferred to commanders of Belgrade, thus creating the Banate of Belgrade, that existed until final Ottoman conquest of Belgrade and \u0160abac in 1521.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nAccording to the Treaty of Tata in 1426 Macs\u00f3 was divided into several districts:\nBitva (Bytthwa),\nGornja and Donja Obna (Felsewatna and Alsowatna),\nRa\u0111evina (Radio, Ragy),\nNepri\u010dava (Neprichow),\nLjig (Ligh),\nKolubara (Collubara),\nUb (Ubmelek),\nTamnava (Tamlavamelek),\nRabas,\nPepeljevac,\nDebrc,\nBeljin,\nToplica and\ncastle of Bela Stena (castle) near present-day Valjevo.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population was mostly Serb and Orthodox, seen in a letter of pope Gregory IX dating 1229, where the pope had ordered the Archbishop of Kalocsa to convert the Orthodox Slavs in Lower Syrmia to the Roman rite.\n\n\n== List of bans ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMa\u010dva\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap",
