Initially, the centre was only open to pre-booked groups but in 2000 it opened fully to the general public.\n\n\n== The animals ==\nThere are approximately 40 species of British wildlife kept at the centre, such as red deer, roe deer, red foxes, weasels, badgers, river otters, hedgehogs, Scottish wildcats, and many more.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe British Wildlife Centre claims to educate and encourage others to participate in wildlife conservation activities and participate in captive breeding programmes.\nVarious animals are fed throughout the day, and regular keeper talks are held at these times. The talks are at approximately 30-minute intervals, with some of the morning talks being repeated in the afternoon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to British Wildlife Centre at Wikimedia Commons",
